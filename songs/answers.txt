maybe with the average of the energy or danceability because with that I can determinate
how motivated they are and either they prefered dance and enjoy the music or they are
more of the sort of hear and analize the music in a deeper way.

This might bring some problems in accuracy due to the poor describe of the person, maybe someone hear
danceable music and at the sama time they hear heavy metal, or k-pop and mixed a lot of differetens sort
of style, so it's complicated.

A better way to do this might be a deeper analysis of the lyrics to see what kind is predominant,
with this you can determinate with more confidence the kind of people they are. though i think this
would be quite inefficient.
