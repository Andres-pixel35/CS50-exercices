Hinamatsuri isn’t just a comedy manga—it’s a masterclass in balancing absurdity with heart.
The way it throws an overpowered psychic girl into the chaotic world of yakuza middlemen and
deadpan delivery is genius, but what sets it apart is how effortlessly it pivots from slapstick
to genuine emotional beats. Nitta’s reluctant father-dynamic with Hina, Hitomi’s terrifyingly
efficient rise in the workforce, and even Anzu’s homeless arc—each thread is hilarious yet oddly
 touching, proving that great comedy doesn’t need to sacrifice depth.

No other manga has made me laugh this hard while still caring deeply about its characters.
The gags are relentless (that damn bartender!), but the series never feels mean-spirited.
Even the side characters get moments to shine, and the pacing is flawless—no joke overstays
 its welcome. It’s the rare comedy where the humor stems from the characters’ personalities,
  not just random absurdity. Hinamatsuri isn’t just the best comedy manga I’ve read; it’s a
  reminder of why I fell in love with the genre.
