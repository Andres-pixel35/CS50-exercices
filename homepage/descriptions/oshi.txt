Being honest, I anticipated greatness with this anime. By the time it was released, I had already read the manga
and fallen in love with the story. When I heard the first episode would last an hour and a half, I knew it would shock
everyone unfamiliar with Oshi. So, the first episode aired—along with its opening—and that day was truly unforgettable
for anyone who loves anime. The plot twist and legendary opening made it a historic moment. Even twenty years from now,
people will remember [Oshi no Ko]. Naturally, both seasons have been stunning, and its second opening has become my
favourite ever.
