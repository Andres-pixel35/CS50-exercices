Youkoso Jitsuryoku Shijou Shugi no Kyoushitsu e remains one of my personal favorites, even as
 its second year arc stumbles under the weight of its own ambition. The first year was a masterclass
 in psychological tension, with Ayanokōji’s chillingly calculated maneuvers and the ruthless social
 dynamics of the ANHS setting a high bar. Yet, while the sequel arcs struggle with pacing and an
 overstuffed cast, the sheer unpredictability of Kiyotaka’s mind games still delivers moments of
 brilliance that remind me why I fell in love with the series.

Yes, the writing has become messier—side characters fade into obscurity, and some twists feel
 contrived—but the core appeal remains. Ayanokōji’s cold, almost inhuman intellect continues to
  fascinate, and when the narrative sharpens its focus, the tension is as gripping as ever. Flawed?
   Absolutely. But when it hits, it hits, and that’s enough to keep me hooked despite the dip in quality.
