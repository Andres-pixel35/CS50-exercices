Blimey, if there’s an anime that’s ever made me stare into my Earl Grey and ponder the relentless march of
time, it’s Sousou no Frieren.

What makes Frieren so ruddy brilliant is how it turns the fantasy genre on its head. Instead of chasing grandeur,
it lingers in the quiet spaces between adventures: sharing stories around a campfire, teaching a young apprentice,
or simply watching the seasons change. The lesson? Time isn’t just something you have; it’s something you lose, often
 without realising its worth until it’s gone. Frieren’s slow-burn epiphany—that mortality gives life its beauty—is a
 gut punch wrapped in serene landscapes and gentle humour. So if you haven’t watched it yet, do yourself a favour: put
  the kettle on, settle in, and let this masterpiece remind you to savour the moments before they become memories.
