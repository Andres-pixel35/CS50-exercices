Honzuki no Gekokujou  struck me like a bolt of lightning—not just as a story, but as a mirror.
Myne’s desperate, clawing passion for books in a world that denies her even that basic joy forced
me to confront my own complacency. How often had I taken for granted the shelves of novels at my
fingertips, or the hours wasted scrolling when I could’ve been laughing with friends? The series
doesn’t preach; it simply shows a life burning too fast, and in its shadow, I found myself reaching
 for the phone less and leaning into conversations more.

There’s a quiet revolution in Myne’s fragility—every cough a ticking clock, every page she writes a
 defiance against time itself. It’s impossible to watch her and not feel the weight of your own
 relationships sharpen into focus. I started calling my sister more after that. Stopped postponing
  pints with mates. Because if a girl in a fantasy world could weaponise her limited days into
  something radiant, then what the hell was my excuse? Honzuki didn’t just move me; it shoved me
  into motion
