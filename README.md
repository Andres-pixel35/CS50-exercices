# What is CS50?

CS50 is a online free couse provided for Harvard and updated each year, there with several teachers they teach the fundaments of computer science

## What does this repo has?

Since I finished the course and I did all the exercises, I wanted to have all that code on my own github. Therefore, I decided to download all my project from the CS50 course and upload them here.

## All the code here is from CS50?

No, back them the codespace of CS50 was the only place I could code, so here are some programs outside the CS50 enviroment. if you are interested on they, you can find them in **Others** and in **anime-list**

## Was AI used here?

kind of, since CS50 didn't allow the use of LLM but they recognise how useful, of inevitable their use was, they provided all of us with an AI from their own which would help us to resolve the problems. Not giving code
but instead givins advising. 

In the final project, which you can find at **project**, they allowed the use of LLM though. 

The final project from CS50 itÂ´s the same that **AniVault** whose repo you can find in my repos.
